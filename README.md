## Overview <a name="overview"></a>

### Objective <a name="objective"></a>

The aim of this project is to establish a method for tracking habits, both healthy and detrimental, in pursuit of a more serene life. Based on daily-filled forms, the system will email a report every morning, indicating whether positive habits are being adhered to and identifying any re-emerging negative habits. The success of this project relies not only on consistent completion of the reports but also on analyzing and understanding the reasons behind each behavioral change.

Striving for better self-management, weekly reports will be sent on Monday mornings, and monthly reports will be dispatched on the first day of each month. This is a dynamic project that has been, is, and will always be subject to change, as life is anything but permanent.
