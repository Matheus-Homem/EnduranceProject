## Overview

### About

1. **What is this project?**
   - The Compass Project is a personal initiative with publicly available code that enables the generation of reports from data collected daily at the beginning and end of the day.

2. **Who’s it intended for?**
   - The intention is to use it solely on a personal level, but the code is made public to serve as a template for others or for presentation purposes. Since the data is of a personal nature, all raw and cleaned databases are hidden, and only refined data that is not extremely personal is available in the repository.

3. **What problem does the project solve?**
   - The project primarily addresses the issue the author faced with journaling over the years, as data was collected but never used to gain insights or revisited in the future; or reviewed past data in the present.
   - With this project, not only is it now possible, but it's also made easier due to structured databases and automated report generation with email delivery. Additionally, it aims to enable comparisons between the current moment and other recorded moments.

4. **How is it going to work?**
   - The project's operation is quite straightforward, with the most challenging aspect being *— and the author believes it will always be —* data generation.
   - Data is generated from two questionnaires, one filled out every morning after waking up and the other filled out every evening *— usually at 19:40 and 21:00 —* after completing the day's activities.
   - The data is then sent to OneDrive, where this repo is hosted on the author's personal machine, then pata processing and report generation occur from there.
   - In the future, for the project to function in its MVP, it will be necessary to send reports by email, creating a system where after the morning entry, the necessary reports for that day are generated, and the author receives the generated PDFs in their email.

5. **What are the main concepts that are involved and how are they related?**
   - The main concepts involved include daily questionnaires, data generation, OneDrive hosting, data processing, and automated report generation. These concepts are interrelated to create a seamless system for tracking habits, with an emphasis on consistent data collection and insightful report delivery.
