   - Example: `chore/update-dependencies`

3. **`fix/` (Fix):**
   - Use this prefix for bug fixes.
   - Example: `fix/resolve-login-issue`

4. **`docs/` (Documentation):**
   - Use this prefix for updates or additions to documentation.
   - Example: `docs/update-readme`

5. **`style/` (Style):**
   - Use this prefix for changes related to code style, formatting, or conventions.
   - Example: `style/fix-indentation`

6. **`test/` (Test):**

## Commit Message Guidelines

1. **Use Clear and Concise Language:**
   - Write commit messages that clearly describe the purpose of the commit in a concise manner.

2. **Use the Present Tense:**
   - Write commit messages in the present tense to describe what the commit does.

3. **Reference Issues:**
   - If the commit relates to a specific issue, reference it in the commit message.

   ```plaintext

   Resolves #123

4. **Separate Subject from Body:**
   - Separate the subject line from the body of the commit message with a blank line.

   ```plaintext
   feat: Add new feature

   This commit adds a new feature to improve user authentication.

## Conclusion

   Following these naming conventions and commit guidelines will contribute to a more organized and understandable version history.
   Consistency in naming and committing practices is essential for effective collaboration within the development team.
