# Directory Organization: *reports*

The reports directory contains the **outputs** of the execution. It is structured as follows: `reports/year/month/day/`

Within each `day` directory, you will find the report generated on that day along with accompanying files necessary for the report's completion (such as images, graphs, etc.).

Due to the personal nature of the information, all files are hidden.
